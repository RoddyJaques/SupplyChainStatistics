    "\n",
    "_\"A distribution is simply a collection of data, or scores, on a variable. Usually, these scores are arranged in order from smallest to largest and then they can be presented graphically.\"_ - Page 6, Statistics in Plain English, Third Edition, 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical distributions are used to quantify and model the spread and uncertainty in a dataset. There are a number of unique distributions to describe different data and situations. Distributions are characterised by different quantities, which can be calculated from observed data. The example of a \"normal distribution\" will be used to explain the use and properties of a statistical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normal Distribution\n",
    "A normal distribution is the most common type of distribution and can be used to accurately describe many real world situations. For example, the heights of people, IQ scores, shoe size and blood pressure are all normally distributed. A normal distribution appears as a symmetrical bell shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is described by the _mean_ (average) and _standard deviation_ (a measure of the spread/variation) of a dataset or population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotted below is the _Probability Density Function_ (PDF) and _Cumulative Density Function_ (CDF) of a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution the shape of the PDF is a symetrical bell shape, with a peak at the mean value. The area under a PDF curve is always 1. The probability of a value being within a given range is equal to the area under the curve between those values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF of a distribution is useful because it shows at what values the data tends to be and how spread it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF shows the probability of a value being less than or equal to a point on the curve. The CDF is useful for determining risk, for example the stockholding needed to meet 95% of demand.  "
